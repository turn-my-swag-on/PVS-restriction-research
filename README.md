**Server-Side Visibility Analytics — Research Proof-of-Concept**

This repository demonstrates a safe, research-oriented approach to server-side visibility tracking for CS2 using SourceMod 1.12. The goal is to show how a server can manage spotted enemies and reduce the potential impact of radar cheats without modifying the engine or VAC.

```

## Features

* Multi-sample LOS checks per target (head/chest/legs + offsets)
* Server-side caching of visibility
* Compact broadcast of spotted entries (enemy ID, expiry, optional zone)
* Configurable ConVars for interval, distance, and FOV culling
* Safe for sharing as a research proof-of-concept

## Usage

1. Compile `src/pvs_amplify.sp` using the SourceMod compiler (`spcomp`) for SourceMod 1.12.
2. Place `pvs_amplify.smx` into `addons/sourcemod/plugins/` on a test server.
3. Tune ConVars in-game or in `plugins.ini` for your server tickrate and hardware.
4. Optionally implement a client HUD to visualize spotted entries for testing purposes.

## Security & Legal Notes

* Plugin uses **only public SourceMod/SDK natives**.
* No engine-level modifications, VAC bypass, or protected memory access.
* Intended for research, testing, and concept demonstration only.
* Suitable for sharing with anti-cheat teams like FACEIT or Valve.

## Zip Archive Generation

You can package the repo into a ZIP for sharing:

### Bash / Linux / WSL / Git Bash

```bash
cd /path/to/repo
zip -r pvs-amplified-research.zip pvs-amplified-research/
unzip -l pvs-amplified-research.zip
```

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
cd C:\path\to\parent
Compress-Archive -Path pvs-amplified-research -DestinationPath pvs-amplified-research.zip
Expand-Archive -Path pvs-amplified-research.zip -DestinationPath C:\temp\unzip_test -Force
```

This creates `pvs-amplified-research.zip` with the complete folder structure, ready to provide to FACEIT or other anti-cheat research teams.
